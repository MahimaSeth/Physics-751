# Physics-751
Code for Physics 751 (special topic) 2022


### WHAT EACH FILE DOES, run in this order. 
# "standalone" means that no other code needs to run beforehand. 
# "dependent" means something needs to run beforehand.

1. "Interactive plot of Lagrange point....py": (standalone) 2D interactive plot showing how L1,L2,L3 shift as mass ratio is changed. 
2. "L2 position calculator, Save to npy file.py": (standalone) calculates the position of all lagrange points for mu values of 0.1-0.6 and saves to a .npy file (we only      used the L2 position in this project). 
3. "L2 positions.npy": (dependent) a file containing the values of the Lagrange points for later use. 
4. "lissajous curves_animate.py": (dependent) 3D interactive animation of the lissajous orbit around the L2 point. 
5. "lissajous curves_animate_xyzframe.py": (dependent) 3D interactive animation of the lissajous orbit around the L2 point along with Earth and Moon.
